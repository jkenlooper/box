# Box

Portable, reliable, reproducable

## Goals

* nvim setup
* workspace sparse disk img. Files are not stored on the host system. Avoid issues with using host app like sqlitestudio accessing db files.
* isolated from host system updates.

* Tools are all on a linux system and easily set up.
* No GUI apps, only using CLI based apps.

## Setup

install vagrant
install virtualbox
Add the workspace.dmg.sparseimage if available or it will create one


## TODO

Where to keep the keys?  Host or?

Sparse disk img transferrable?
